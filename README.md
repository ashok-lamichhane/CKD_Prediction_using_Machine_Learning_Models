# CKD_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Models
This is the Machine Learning Project in which I solved the classification problem of Chronic Kidney Disease Classification Using five classification models.

This is the course project of CSE427 Machine Learning Course of BRAC Univeristy, in which we used 5 ML classification models to predict weather a person have CKD or not based on different types of features. We used [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEyO-o_aL5mIgl717l0bu9rks4XPFK6B/view?usp=drive_link) dataset for this project. 

Here are used Models:
1. Random Forest (RF)
2. Logistric Regression (LR)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. Kernel Naive Bayes (NV)

Among this models, SVM perform better with 96.3% accuracy and F1-score. You can access presentaion video of this project from [here](https://youtu.be/56_UAReHT0E).
