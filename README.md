# CKD_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Models
This is the Machine Learning Project in which I solved the classification problem of Chronic Kidney Disease Classification Using five classification models.

This is the course project of CSE427 Machine Learning Course of BRAC Univeristy, in which we used 5 ML classification models to predict weather a person have CKD or not based on different types of features. We used [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQh3TIzoLOGq9B45tHg_wTyJwsYJCpZf/view?usp=sharing) dataset for this project.
